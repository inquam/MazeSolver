Simple maze solver implemented in Python. Created as part of speedrunning a one free month on boot.dev.

In `__animate` in the `Maze`class there is a sleep call to make it all go a bit slower so one can see what the program is doing.
Remove this to speed the solver up.

You can also set the window size and size of the maze in `main` along with the graphical size of cells by altering `WALL_LENGTH` in `cell.py`.
